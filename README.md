# Wasa-Bee! Restaurant Review Analysis

## Project Overview
"Wasa-Bee!" project embarks on an insightful journey through restaurant reviews, leveraging the potent capabilities of NLP to unearth valuable insights. Central to our analytical arsenal is BERT, a groundbreaking model that has revolutionized our approach to understanding customer feedback. This project aims to distill sentiments and themes from reviews, providing actionable intelligence for restaurant management and strategic planning.

## Data Source
Dataset from [https://www.yelp.com/dataset]

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an in-depth EDA to identify patterns, trends, and unique insights within the restaurant review dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized the BERT model and sentiment analysis, extracting nuanced sentiments from the textual reviews to better understand customer experiences.
- **Data Visualization:** Leveraged libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize findings and trends effectively, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** Utilized for implementing the BERT model, showcasing our use of cutting-edge deep learning libraries.
- **NLP Libraries:** Integration of BERT for sophisticated text analysis and sentiment extraction.

## Key Findings
Our analysis has identified three top zip codes in Pennsylvania that offer optimal conditions for the launch of Wasa-bee’s sushi restaurant with minimal competition:
- **19403**: Montgomery County
- **19149**: Philadelphia County
- **19348**: Kennett Square

These areas exhibit a high positive sentiment in customer reviews, paired with a low density of competing restaurants, presenting a unique opportunity for market entry and success. These locations are poised to offer a strategic advantage in the market and are vital for Wasa-bee's expansion plans.

## Future Work
The promising initial findings from the sentiment analysis and location targeting provide a solid foundation for Wasa-bee's expansion strategy. Future work will delve deeper into understanding market dynamics by:
- Expanding the scope of data analysis to cover additional geographical areas and demographic insights.
- Refining the NLP models to capture more nuanced sentiments and possibly integrating more sophisticated language processing technologies.
- Exploring other aspects of customer reviews, such as seasonality effects and long-term customer value, to further inform the restaurant's business strategy.
- Considering the broader economic and cultural factors that could impact the success of a new sushi restaurant in the identified locations.
- Investigating the competitive landscape in more detail, including direct and indirect competitors, to find additional strategic advantages.


## Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis pinpointed Pennsylvania as the most promising state for the success of Wasa-bee, based on a robust dataset. By leveraging detailed data analysis, we identified three top zip codes within Pennsylvania - 19403, 19348, and 19149 - as prime locations for Wasa-bee's establishment. This strategic focus on Pennsylvania provides a strong foundation for Wasa-bee’s expansion and success in the competitive restaurant landscape.
